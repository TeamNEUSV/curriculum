# Randomness challenges

## Challenge 1:
### What was the scenario
"You are in charge of writing a software for a slot machine. On press of a button, the slot machine should output the n rolls of dice.
constraints: Do not use the random library(Random). Probability of the dice rolls should be equal."
### Simplify problem
say we simulate 2 rolls of dice,  calling  the generator will produce a number between (2, 12) with same probability.
